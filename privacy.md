## Privacy Policy: SmartPage Summariser

SmartPage Summariser is a Chrome extension that helps users summarize webpage content using their own OpenAI API key.

### Data Collection

We do **not** collect or store any personal data or browsing history.

### Data Usage

- The extension uses **your OpenAI API key** to send prompts and receive summaries from OpenAI's servers.
- All prompts and responses are processed **client-side** and are not stored or transmitted externally by us.

### Permissions

The extension requests:

- `activeTab` and `tabs` — to access the current page you are summarizing
- `storage` — to save your API key and custom prompts locally
- `scripting` — to inject content scripts during summarization

### Third-Party Services

We use the OpenAI API to generate summaries. You are responsible for complying with [OpenAI's terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).
